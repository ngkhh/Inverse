# Inverse [DEMO]
## About
Inverse relies on a concept where the player can flip/inverse gravity for themselves at will, with a limit.
By using this ability, the player must navigate through many levels, travelling on the floor and ceiling, and even in the air.
The game tracks your every death so maybe don't die too much.
